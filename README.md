## Description

This Infinite Scrolling demo app avoids loading all items at once. Instead, it retrieves data from a REST API as the user scrolls down the list, improving efficiency and optimizing memory usage. Additionally, it implements a prefetching technique to load data before the user sees it, resulting in a smoother user experience.
